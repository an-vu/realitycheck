# Reality Check

A tool designed to diagnose and optimize 3D models for AR compatibility on iOS devices. It analyzes .fbx and .usdz files, provides feedback on model performance, and suggests optimizations based on device specifications.

## Features

- **Model Analysis**: Detects issues like high polygon count, large texture sizes, and inefficient compression.

- **Device Compatibility Check**: Identifies whether a model will work on specific iPhone models.

- **Optimization Suggestions**: Recommends adjustments for better AR performance.

- **Automated Troubleshooting**: Flags common issues that prevent models from displaying in AR.

- **Machine Learning Integration (Future Scope)**: Leverages AI to improve optimization recommendations over time.
